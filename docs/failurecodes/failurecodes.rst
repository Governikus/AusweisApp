Failure Codes
=============
The |AppName| will send failure codes indicating what went wrong and where it happened as well as
how to solve it.

Helpful tips
------------
The following tips will help you to prevent many of the failures mentioned in the next section.
Also they assist you in receiving further guidance and help.

.. _failure_code_card_position:

Check ID card position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Check the position of your ID card on the smartphone or card reader. Especially with smartphones,
the field strength for the power supply of the ID card is not always sufficient. If you place your
smartphone on your ID card, please also ensure that your surface is not electrically conductive,
as this can then disrupt or prevent communication with the ID card. If all of the above does not
work, please see :ref:`failure_code_replace_card_or_card_reader`.

.. _failure_code_contact_support:

Contact support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the provided failure code did not help to resolve the issue, please contact the support
(https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/help-and-support), including the error code, situation
description, and logfile, so that they can identify issues in your system configuration or
|AppName|. If you are using the |AppName| you will find the logfile in the Help section.

.. _failure_code_inform_service_provider:

Inform service provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Directly notify the service provider if the failure code contained an incorrect TLS or service
configuration. Usually the service provider contact information are available on the website on
which you have started the authentication.

.. _failure_code_fix_connections_problems:

Fix connection problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For any failure code that mentions connection issues in its cause, it is recommended to check your
current connection. Verify an active internet connection, by opening e.g.
https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de in the browser of your choice. This includes checking your firewall
and antivirus configuration as well as your local network hardware. Ultimately the problem may be
with your telecommunications provider, or the service provider. Please refer to the attached
\"Network_Error\" for details. If you are using the |AppName|, the diagnosis, which is located in
the help section, may assist you in finding issues.

.. _failure_code_replace_card_or_card_reader:

Replace ID card of card reader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It cannot be ruled out that your ID card is defective or, due to necessary updates, initially
requires more power than your current smartphone or card reader can supply. If possible, try other
card readers or smartphones.
If the ID card still does not work you might need to replace it with a new one at your responsible
authority.
