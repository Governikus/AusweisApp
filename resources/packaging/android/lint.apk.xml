        The used version is provided by Qt in the build.gradle. Its not
        practical to update Qt on every new version. Providing our own
        build.gradle would bind us to take over the changes in Qt into
        our own build.gradle frequently.

    <!-- Unused resources.

        Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

        Qt includes some resources like strings, which are seen by lint to be unused.

    <!-- Activity is set to be non resizeable

        The `<activity>` element should be allowed to be resized to allow users to take advantage of the multi-window
        environments available on larger screen Android devices. To fix the issue, consider declaring the corresponding
        activity element with `resizableActivity="true"` attribute.

        We can ignore it as the AusweisApp2 still doesn't properly support multi-window environments.

    <!-- Data tags should only declare unique attributes

        Consider splitting data tag into multiple tags with individual attributes to avoid confusion `data`
        tags should only declare a single unique attribute (i.e. scheme OR host, but not both). This better
        matches the runtime behavior of intent filters, as they combine all of the declared data attributes
        into a single matcher which is allowed to handle any combination across attribute types.

        The plugin version is set by Qt itself, so no need to warn us about an outdated version, since this has to be
        updated in Qt itself.
