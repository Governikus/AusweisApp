    <!-- Class is not registered in the manifest.

        Activities, services and content providers should be registered in the
        AndroidManifest.xml file using <activity>, <service> and <provider> tags.

        If your activity is simply a parent class intended to be subclassed
        by other "real" activities, make it an abstract class.

        We can not make the classes abstract, because Qt provides
        it and it should be possible to use it without subclassing.

        The used version is provided by Qt in the build.gradle. Its not
        practical to update Qt on every new version. Providing our own
        build.gradle would bind us to take over the changes in Qt into
        our own build.gradle frequently.

    <!-- Obsolete custom lint check

        Lint can be extended with custom checks: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example
        enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.
        The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working,
        or provide wrong results.
        This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated
        to run in the current lint environment.
        It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer
        version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

    <!-- Unused Exported service does not require permission.

         Exported services (services which either set exported=true or contain
         an intent-filter and do not specify exported=false) should define a
         permission that an entity must have in order to launch the service or
         bind to it. Without this, any application can use this service.

         We decided to ignore this warning because we do not want to limit the
         access to the service. Any application should be able to use the
         service without additional barriers.
