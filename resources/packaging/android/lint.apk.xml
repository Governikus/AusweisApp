    <!-- Unused resources.

        Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

        Qt includes some resources like strings, which are seen by lint to be unused.

    <!-- Unused Exported service does not require permission.

         Exported services (services which either set exported=true or contain
         an intent-filter and do not specify exported=false) should define a
         permission that an entity must have in order to launch the service or
         bind to it. Without this, any application can use this service.

         We decided to ignore this warning because we do not want to limit the
         access to the service. Any application should be able to use the
         service without additional barriers.

    <!-- AndroidGradlePluginVersion

        The plugin version is set by Qt itself, so no need to warn us about an outdated version, since this has to be
        updated in Qt itself.

        Qt is using some discouraged API. They are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
        for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior). which we can't change, so ignore it.

    <!-- TrustAllX509TrustManager

        checkClientTrusted is empty, which could cause insecure network
        traffic due to trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers.

        This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose checkServerTrusted or
        checkClientTrusted methods do nothing (thus trusting any certificate chain) which
        could result in insecure network traffic caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL
        certificates presented by peers.
