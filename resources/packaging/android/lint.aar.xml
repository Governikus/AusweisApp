        Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

        Qt includes some resources like strings, which are seen by lint to be unused.

    <!-- AndroidGradlePluginVersion

        The plugin version is set by Qt itself, so no need to warn us about an outdated version, since this has to be
        updated in Qt itself.

    <!-- ChromeOsAbiSupport

        This is a false positive since the gradle.build defines
            ndk.abiFilters = qtTargetAbiList.split(",")
        which may or not contain "x86" or "x86_64".

    <!-- Instantiatable

        AusweisApp2Service must extend android.app.Service

        This is a false positive since this is given in the inheritance hierarchy.
