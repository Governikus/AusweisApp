    <!-- Obsolete Gradle Dependency.

        The used version is provided by Qt in the build.gradle. Its not
        practical to update Qt on every new version. Providing our own
        build.gradle would bind us to take over the changes in Qt into
        our own build.gradle frequently.

    <!-- Unused resources.

        Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

        Qt includes some resources like strings, which are seen by lint to be unused.

    <!-- AndroidGradlePluginVersion

        The plugin version is set by Qt itself, so no need to warn us about an outdated version, since this has to be
        updated in Qt itself.

    <!-- DiscouragedApi

        Qt is using some discouraged API. They are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
        for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior). which we can't change, so ignore it.
