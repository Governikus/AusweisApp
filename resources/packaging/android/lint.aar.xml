    <!-- Unused resources.

        Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

        Qt includes some resources like strings, which are seen by lint to be unused.

    <!-- AndroidGradlePluginVersion

        The plugin version is set by Qt itself, so no need to warn us about an outdated version, since this has to be
        updated in Qt itself.

    <!-- DiscouragedApi

        Qt is using some discouraged API. They are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
        for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior). which we can't change, so ignore it.
