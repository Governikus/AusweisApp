Subject: iOS: Don't assume screens will not be connected before
 QIOSIntegration

When an external screen is connected to an iPad, and the application is
starting up on that screen, we will get a connection notification about
that screen as part of the initial bootstrap of UIApplicationMain,
before we call the user's main().

Since we initialize and add all available screen on QIOSIntegration
creation, we can just ignore the early connection notification.

This avoids a crash, but the window will not show anything on the
external screen, which is a separate issue.

Pick-to: 6.5 6.4 6.2
Fixes: QTBUG-106701
